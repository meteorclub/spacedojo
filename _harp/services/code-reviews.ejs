				<h3>Code reviews lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</h3>
				<p>As you already know, fine tuning your Meteor application is a vital step in your growth cycle. Sometimes it can be simple: turn on Oplog support and add a few backend servers. Other times, you need to go deeper and pick code apart. Ultimately, you may need to take a look at denormalizing, changing your database structure, or adding microservices.</p>

      	<p>Nonetheless, it is vital to set time aside, get baseline measurements, and understand where performance problems may occur&mdash;long before you get that 2 AM email that everything is down. </p>

								<ul>
									<li>You are a small or medium business with a Meteor application running in production.</li>

				<h3>How do you know this will work?</h3>
				<p>I have over ten years of experience building and optimizing web applications, starting with Ruby on Rails. I've worked with companies such as Words With Friends and GoDaddy. At GoDaddy I was on a team that scaled and reworked the backend in an effort to reduce overall hosting costs. Not only did we reduce costs, we also managed to get the bank syncing job queue from not finishing to running twice a day.</p>

      	<p>More recently, I transitioned into developing with Meteor.js. Still, I continue to help companies optimize their application's performance.</p>

      	<h4>Here's one example...</h4>
      	<p>One of my clients, <a href="http://worklife.com">WorkLife</a>, is a web and mobile app that helps people run more productive meetings by offering real time collaboration features. Some of their customers include Toyota, Hubspot and Zendesk.</p>

      	<p>As I began optimizing their inner workings for maximum efficiency, I identified that one of their publications had the second highest subscribe rate across the application, with an average response time of 2171ms.</p>

      	<img src="/static/images/wl_response_before.png" style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 40px;" alt="">

      	<p>Essentially, the problem was that WorkLife's database was doing more work than it had to. After identifying the problem in the database, I added a simple line of code to tell the database to add an index. <strong>This small change led to a <em>15X performance increase</em></strong>.</p>

				<h3>How do we get started?</h3>
				<p><strong>At the moment, Code Reviews has no open slots.</strong> However, you can sign up below to get on the waiting list and be notified first when slots do become available. I’ll follow up with a few more questions so we can both see if this will be a good fit.</p>
